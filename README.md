tinder-desktop
========

It's a node-webkit (now nw.js) app.

You'll need to run `npm install` in both the main directory, and inside of desktop-app before starting.

To compile your changes and test:

First, download node-webkit (currently using [v0.11.6](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/wiki/Downloads-of-old-versions#v0116-jan-21-2015))

To start the app:

```
cd desktop-app
/path/to/your/nwjs .
```

Note: if you don't have Wine installed and want to run the build script (`node build.js`), just delete the `winIco` field from build.js
